I am a professor of theoretical physics at the Cavendish Lab, University of Cambridge. My research interests include shape-shifting solids (where the metric changes responsively), soft complex matter, statistical physics. I collaborate with the theoretical and experimental mechanics group of John Biggins, Cambridge Engineering Department, on novel mechanics, strong actuation from changes in metric, and possible connections with morphogenesis.
