  Liquid crystal elastomers and glasses can have significant shape change
  determined by their director patterns. Cones deformed from circular director
  patterns have nontrivial Gaussian curvature localized at tips, curved
  interfaces, and intersections of interfaces. We employ a generalized metric
  compatibility condition to characterize two families of interfaces between
  circular director patterns, hyperbolic and elliptical interfaces, and find
  that the deformed interfaces are geometrically compatible. We focus on
  hyperbolic interfaces to design complex topographies and nonisometric origami,
  including n-fold intersections, symmetric and irregular tilings.

  The large design space of threefold and fourfold tiling is utilized to quantitatively inverse design an array of pixels to display target images. Taken together, our findings provide comprehensive design principles for the design of actuators, displays, and soft robotics in liquid crystal elastomers and glasses.
